To the few of you who previously followed the old ym2612:

http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1450 Nemesis has decided to use a very restrictive non-commercial-use no-forks-of-core-allowed open-source-plugins-only license on Exodus, which basically renders the previou ym2612 infringing. ym2612 was created to have an accurate emulator core that is liberally licensed; that would be the exact opposite of this. I am required to start the entire project from scratch again. Sorry about that.
